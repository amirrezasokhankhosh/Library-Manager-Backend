# Library-Manager-Backend

Back-end part of an app--written with Django-responsible for managing the variety of activities that take place in a library.

## Introduction

This repository is responsible for the Back-end part of the Library Manager application. I formulated daily processes of libraries in this manner:

This application should have 2 user types. **Admin-user** which is responsible for the management of books, memberships, and borrowing books. **Guest-user** which gives non-staff individuals the ability to search through the database for books. This search can be based on author, bookâ€™s name, and its publication.

## Required Applications

- PostgreSQL

## How to Use

First, install the required packages

```markdown
py install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create a database in pgadmin4 and name it **Library_Manager**. After creating the database, you should restore the back-up file in the Database folder. 

After that run the following commands in your terminal.

```markdown
py manage.py migrate
py manage.py runserver
```

Finally, you will be able to see that the server is now running on **127.0.0.1:8000**
